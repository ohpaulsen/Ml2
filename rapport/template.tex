\section{Learning as a Search}
\subsection{Global optimal solutions}
\subsection{Genetic Algorithm(GA)}
\subsection{Gradient Descent method}
\subsection{Performance domain}

\section{Statistical Learning}
\subsection{Computer program}
I did the programming in Python with the library Numpy and Time. You need to install Numpy, but time is a core
library of Python. Numpy are used to handle sqrt, max, min and mathematical functions on arrays. I also used Numpy
to read in data from the txt files. Numpy also have functions for Euclidean and chebyshev, but they are NOT used in my program.

K Neaarest Neighbor are also programmed by from the bottom instead of using a library. 

*K nearst Neighbor code*

The program are scaled to handle large amount of input, both train and validation data, and 13 attributes takes under 3 secounds to handle.

\subsection{Read input files}

The train.txt and validation.txt are read into the program with Numpy's genfromtxt.
*genfromtxt code* 

I save the input data in a masked arrays. and split out the label into a own array.

*Splitting code* 

I confirm the input is 120 train samples and 10 validation samples in the output.

\subsection{Radar and Area plot}
\subsection{Distance Algorythms}

The follow three algorithms are included into the program:

Euclidean:

Squar Euclidean:

Chebyshev:

As you can see they got different output from each other
\subsection{Output}

The output of the program is as follow:
